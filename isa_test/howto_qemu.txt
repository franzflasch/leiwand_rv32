# You can also start the tests with qemu with this command:
qemu-system-riscv32 -nographic -machine sifive_e -kernel addi.elf -d in_asm,cpu -s -S

# After qemu is started you need to connect via gdb to single step through all instructions:
riscv32-none-elf-gdb -ex "target remote localhost:1234" -ex "b _start" -ex "c" addi.elf

# Single instruction step would be:
stepi or si

# A good workflow would be to set the breakpoint to the "pass" function to check if the test reaches the end of the tests:
riscv32-none-elf-gdb -ex "target remote localhost:1234" -ex "b pass" bne.elf

# If the CPU breaks at the pass function everything should be fine. You can also scrollback the qemu monitor output to check 
# instructions and register values.

# Kill qemu with this command:
kill -9 $(pidof qemu-system-riscv32)
